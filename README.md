## Editor

1. **Focus Editor**

Juggling multiple editors is a common challenge. While sometime I will have multiple editors open for reviewing, when I need to focus on one specific editor but I also don't want to close others. This shortcut becomes really handy. Ensuring that the editor you need is always at the forefront.

Instead of manually combing through the project to discover its various callers, with a this shortcut, I can seamlessly navigate to the caller tab. And gain a deeper understanding of the project's architecture.

3. **Show document items**
	- (⌃ Control) + 6

This shortcut comes handy once we need to check all the function, variable, class or extenion etc... in the file. This would open up the tab that help visualize the those in the current file.

1. **Code Completion**

One of my favorite shortcut while exploring the new field of the codebase. "Show Quick Help" opens a pop-up window displaying quick documentation and information about that specific API or code symbol. This is helpful for exploring the details of APIs, functions, and classes without having to navigate away from current tab.
